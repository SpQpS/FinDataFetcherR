# Financial Data Fetching with R Programming
**This R script fetches financial data, such as stock prices, using the Alpha Vantage API. It provides a simple way to retrieve the latest close price for a given stock symbol.**

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, you need to obtain an API key from Alpha Vantage. You can sign up for a free account and obtain the key [here](https://www.alphavantage.co/).

## Installation

Make sure you have the required R packages installed. You can install them using the following commands or download Required_Packages file:

- In R Studio:
  
   - ```install.packages("httr")```

   - ```install.packages("jsonlite")```

## Configuration
- Replace the placeholder ```YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY``` in the script with your actual Alpha Vantage API key.

**Copy code**
- Alpha Vantage API key (replace with your key)
   - api_key <- "YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY"

## Usage
- Run the R script ```financial_script.R``` in your R environment. You can do this by opening the script in RStudio or running it in the R console.
- The script provides an example of fetching stock data for a specific symbol (AAPL for Apple Inc.). You can customize the script to fetch data for different stock symbols dynamically.

**Copy code**
#Example: Get stock data for a specific symbol (e.g., Apple Inc.)
```get_stock_data("AAPL")```

## Customization and Expansion

**Feel free to customize and expand the project according to your needs:**

- Allow dynamic input for stock symbols.
- Enhance error handling and provide user-friendly messages.
- Fetch historical stock prices and perform data analysis.
- Create visualizations using ggplot2 or other plotting libraries.
- Build a Shiny app for a more interactive experience.
